# BN_Update
A Cataclysm Bright Nights updater. Stick in an empty folder. Wildly unfinished.

#TODO:
This originally had a backup function that it's not using anymore because I got tired of seeing people talk about the launcher's problems.
It's currently hardcoded to a build because the win64 tiles build broke last night when I was working on it.
I could probably just make it read a list of strings and where to put the files and make it universal.
